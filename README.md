*I am aware that there are currently many bugs (with varying degrees of severity) in the drills.js mod. I will fix them when I can, but in April-June this year I am taking/preparing for exams, meaning I will likely be unable to update/fix this mod until around June-July of this year. While I might have some time to make progress on this mod during the exam period, that it unlikely (and the time would still be very limited). Apologies for the inconvenience. - @NecroticPhantom
